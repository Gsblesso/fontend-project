Project Name – frontend-project (Interactive Quiz App)

## 🧠 Interactive Quiz App

This project is a visually polished and interactive quiz application built using **React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS**.  
It features a multi-step quiz flow with smooth navigation, subtle animations, dynamic progress indicators, and a clean, modern results screen.

The application evaluates user responses, calculates the final score as a percentage, animates the score from 0 to the final value, and displays a real-time progress bar. Based on the user’s performance, the result screen dynamically shows appreciation or motivational feedback. Questions are shuffled on every attempt to ensure variety and prevent predictable order.

The UI uses soft gradients, shadows, glass-style cards, and responsive layouts, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile screens.
